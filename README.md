# Fine-Tuning-DeepSeek
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning DeepSeek models on custom datasets. The notebook provides a structured workflow for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference using Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to enhance efficiency.
